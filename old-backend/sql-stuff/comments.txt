Suggestions
---
Use a class diagram, it provides are very detailed level of modelling, since it models both data
and process.  

Put all photos/images in their own table, have a link table which allows you to allocate
photos to other table rows.. this is so a gift can have multiple images

Have a category table, so the categories can be updated without modifying the codebase.

Also you need to be able to add gifts to multiple categories. For example a Liverpool
United scarf would be in catergories 26,28. 

Something a bit strange about the association with username in wishlist and gift profiles
and the username in users table, one is integer the other is string, if this is a foreign
key reference in the wishlist it should refer to the id column in the users table.

Age is not a good attribute in users, always use date of birth, age is then calculated depending
on the current date, (otherwise you have to keep updating it).

If you want to keep privacy high, you can just store year of birth.

Age in gift category, seems to be a VARCHAR(15) is this an age range column, you perhaps need
to have another table, age catergories and then a linking table to allow a gift to be allocated
to multiple age groups. Consider using inheritance, have entity user and the inherit from it giftRUser,
user will just contain username, password and role.
